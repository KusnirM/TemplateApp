# Template App

This Android template app provides a powerful foundation for scalable, maintainable, and cross-platform development by
incorporating **Kotlin Multiplatform**, **Android Dynamic Features**, **Flutter Module integration**, and **MVVM Clean
Architecture**. It also includes a comprehensive **Unit Testing** framework to ensure code quality.

## Key Features:

### 1. Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP)

The template uses Kotlin Multiplatform to share core business logic across Android and iOS platforms, promoting code
reuse and reducing redundancy. This helps maintain a consistent experience across platforms while preserving native UI
for each.

### 2. Android Dynamic Features

The app structure leverages Dynamic Feature Modules, enabling modular development where features can be delivered on
demand. This leads to better performance by optimizing the app's size and startup time. Users can download and access
specific features only when needed, streamlining the app experience.

### 3. Flutter Module Integration

This template showcases the integration of a Flutter module within an Android project, allowing developers to
incorporate Flutter’s UI toolkit for specific parts of the app. This approach combines the power of Flutter’s
cross-platform capabilities with Android’s native performance and features.

### 4. MVVM Clean Architecture

The app follows **Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM)** with **Clean Architecture** principles, providing a clear separation of
concerns:

- **Domain Layer:** Contains the business logic and use cases, which are platform-independent and easy to test.
- **Data Layer:** Handles data management, including networking, databases, and repositories, abstracting data sources.
- **Presentation Layer:** Uses ViewModels to manage UI-related logic, interacting with the domain layer, and providing
  data to the UI in a clean, reactive way using LiveData or StateFlow.

This architecture ensures that the app is scalable, maintainable, and testable by separating the concerns of the UI,
business logic, and data handling.

### 5. Unit Testing

The project is built with testing in mind, featuring unit tests for both the **shared Kotlin Multiplatform code** and *
*Android native components**. The MVVM architecture also allows for easy testing of the business logic and ViewModels in
isolation, ensuring the app’s stability through automated tests.

## Conclusion

This template serves as a solid foundation for building cross-platform apps with a modular, scalable, and testable
architecture while leveraging both native Android capabilities and Flutter's rich UI framework.
